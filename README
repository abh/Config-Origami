Config::Origami makes it easy to have a "layered" system of default
configuration, environment specific configuration and overrides.

This is to make it easy to manage the configuration of an application
"as code" in revision control without unnecessary duplication and
without having to store sensitive information such as database
passwords in version control.

The configuration files are stored in a directory of .json files.
